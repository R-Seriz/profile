            I used to visit Okinawa as a child for vacation. It was years later when I took a class
            on Japanese history in my senior year of high school that I learned some of its darker history and
            struggles. These photos were taken during a fieldtrip to Okinawa days before graduation. Clearly,
            the struggles are far from over. U.S. military bases occupy the land and its people with the
            support and funding from the mainland government.<br><br>

            Prior to the trip, I had the privilege of meeting Okinawan photographer Ishikawa Mao. I am
            greatly inspired by her lifelong work in documenting both the struggle and beauty of the everyday lives
            of fringe members within Okinawan and Japanese society. Her work and legacy speaks for itself. <br><br>

            But, what has stuck with me the most is the encounter I had with one of the visitors at the exhibition.
            After briefly talking to Ishikawa Mao, I was approached by a middle-aged Japanese woman. Her eyes were
            already swelled with tears. She introduced herself as an activist based in Tokyo. 
            and relayed to me a message of hope. Hope for the future of Okinawa. Hope that
            the
            younger generation will continue the efforts of preserving and sharing the stories of Okinawa. <br><br>
