    <div class="gallery-description"> Winter break of my first year in college, I went back to Tokyo.
        I visited one of the University of Tokyo dorms for a reunion with my good old friends. 
        These were some photos I took while we played pool together. I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia from our high school days.
