        <p><strong>05 12 25</strong>flow & the present.</p>

        <p><strong>05 05 25</strong> I'm young, naive, and unsure about many things, but this is what I want my future
            to look like
            as of today. For my career, I don't want to settle on a single pursuit. I want the flow of life to take me
            whereever. I want to continually try new things. I want to be moving around every couple of years, exploring
            new ideas in new places. I have trouble thinking about the world as a whole. There's a lot going on, all at
            once. So, I want to care and focus my attention on those around me. I want to focus my efforts to my
            immediate surroundings. I want to form strong connections. Close relationships with three people: someone
            older,
            someone younger, and someone who is the same in age. At some point, I want to be content with myself and my
            life. It won't mean I'm
            happy all the time, but that I know myself well enough to get through any struggle. I admit being ambitious
            in pursuing
            these goals, but I have to start somewhere. Right?
