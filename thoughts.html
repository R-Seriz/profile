        <p><strong>Introduction</strong> <br> when I started building this site, I realized I wanted it to serve to purposes:
            First, it needed to be practical as a portfolio of my work and experience. On the other hand, I liked the
            idea of having my own little corner on the Internet. To compensate for both, the site function as a
            portfolio at the surface, but I have hidden external links across the site for those who are a little more
            curious. You've found one of these links, but there are some more if you're interested.
            Anyways, thanks for stopping by!

        <p><strong>05 17 18</strong> perhaps, a tree is the perfect reminder of what it means to be alive. The tree is
            ever-growing, but not all trees grow at the same time nor rate. The tree is constantly exposed to the change
            of its surroundings. Occasionally a storm or strong wind will blow away its branches and leaves, but the
            tree will stand so long as its roots are gounded well.</p>

        <p><strong>05 14 25</strong> one's strength should be measured based on the ability to absorb hate into love.
            The strongest people in my mind are those who spread joy, laughter, and love in face of struggle. I don't
            think of it as naivety or indifference. I think it's true strength. To that end, I have a lot of room to
            grow stronger.

        <p><strong>05 12 25</strong> the flow & the present.</p>

        <p><strong>05 05 25</strong> I'm young, naive, and unsure about many things, but this is what I want my future
            to look like as of today. For my career, I don't want to settle on a single pursuit. I want the flow of life
            to take me whereever. I want to continually try new things. I want to be moving around every couple of
            years, exploring new ideas in new places. I have trouble thinking about the world as a whole. There's a lot
            going on, all at once. So, I want to care and focus my attention on those around me. I want to focus my
            efforts to my immediate surroundings. I want to form strong connections. Close relationships with three
            people: someone older, someone younger, and someone who is the same in age. At some point, I want to be
            content with myself and my life. It won't mean I'm happy all the time, but that I know myself well enough to
            get through any struggle. I admit being ambitious in pursuing these goals, but I have to start somewhere.
            Right?</p>
